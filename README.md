# riscv-to-wasm

Riscv-to-wasm is a transpiler that translates risc-v source to wasm source. This is done by first compiling the risc-v source code to its binary representation
and then parsing its binary representation to wasm binary file. The wasm binary file is then translated to its wasm source code.
